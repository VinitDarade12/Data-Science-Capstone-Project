# Data-Science-Capstone-Project
This project is a Machine Learning based Car Price Prediction App that uses Linear Regression to predict the selling price of a car based on features like the year of manufacture and kilometers driven.

![app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/048d0d0c-6364-44c6-8caf-572c4ffaba68)
Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, performed one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and scaled numeric features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distributions, correlations, and trends using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Modeling: Built a Linear Regression model to predict car prices with a good balance between accuracy and interpretability.
Deployment: The trained model is deployed on Streamlit for real-time predictions with user inputs. The app is hosted via Streamlit Cloud.
